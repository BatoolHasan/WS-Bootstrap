# Accessibility
Accessibility refers to how accessible your interface is to users with different disabilities. Your users could have different disabilities such as color blindless, weak vision, or poor motor skills, and it is your responsibility as a developer to create an interface they can interact with comfortably.

Accessibility in the web is a large sea of knowledge and can be overwhelming at the beginning, but you should always think of your end users.

[Bootstrapâ€™s documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/accessibility/) aims to provide developers with best practice examples to demonstrate the appropriate semantic markup, including ways in which potential accessibility concerns can be addressed.
