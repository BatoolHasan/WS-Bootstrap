# Spacing
Bootstrap comes equipped with several CSS classes that you can use to add spacing to your elements. Whether its margin, or spacing, Bootstrap has you covered!
<br/>
Using Bootstrapâ€™s spacing classes helps you keep your spacing consistent. Consistency is extremely important to the user, the difference between these two pictures is just spacing! ðŸ¤¯

With time and practice, your eyes will be trained to help you choose the right amount of spacing.
Notice how our search and logout buttons are stuck together?

Letâ€™s apply a margin to its left to space it away from the search button.
In Bootstrap, margins are categorized by: `top`, `bottom`, `start`, and `end`. In our case, applying a `margin to the right` of the logout button will space it away.
<br/>
Letâ€™s apply `ms-2`
```html
...
<button class="btn btn-outline-secondary text-uppercase ms-2">log out</button>
...
```
