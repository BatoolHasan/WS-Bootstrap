# Installation
For most intents and purposes, you can use Bootstrap’s cdn. However, because we will talk about Bootstrap’s CSS variables, we will need Bootstrap’s files to be available locally. For that reason, we will install bootstrap as a dependency. Open the terminal, ***make sure you are in the correct project folder***, and run:
<br/>
`npm init -y`
<br/>
`npm i bootstrap`
<br/>
Notice now that we have access to all of Bootstrap’s files inside our `node_modules/bootstrap`.
