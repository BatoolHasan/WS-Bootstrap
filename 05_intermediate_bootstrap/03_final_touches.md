# Final Touches
Compare your page to Warehouse’s. There are still a few things we can change to make it a clone, take these as a challenge 🌶:
<br/>
<ol>
    <li>Add Warehouse’s title in the head.</li>
    <li>Add Warehouse’s favicon.</li>
    <li>Use the font family “Poppins” (hint: get it from Google Fonts).</li>
    <li>Change the navbar’s background to white and add a border bottom (only use Bootstrap to achieve this).</li>
    <li>Add a footer.</li>
</ol>
